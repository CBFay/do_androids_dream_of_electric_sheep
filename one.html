                <p>A merry little surge of electricity piped by 
                    automatic alarm from the mood organ beside his
                    bed awakened Rick Deckard. Surprised — it always
                    surprised him to find himself awake without prior
                    notice — he rose from the bed, stood up in his 
                    multicolored pajamas, and stretched. Now, in her 
                    bed, his wife Iran opened her gray, unmerry eyes,
                    blinked, then groaned and shut her eyes again. </p>
